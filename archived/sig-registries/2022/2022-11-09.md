    * It will get to take advantage of existing content we produced but did not use for that talk
* [Robin] - Meeting Structure
    * We will keep holding these meetings with a focus on the high-level requirements, design, and specification of the project e.g. questions about the proposal itself
    * There's additionally a working group meeting people are welcome to join (message Robin in Zulip or the #warg channel) that will go into more detail about the design and coordinating the implementation
