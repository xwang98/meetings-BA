* [Bailey] - Meeting recording poll
    * https://github.com/bytecodealliance/SIG-Registries/discussions/46
* [Radu] - Cancelling during break?
    * none opposed to canceling the next two weeks of meetings for the holiday
* [Robin] - Do package URLs contain version information in addition to the new version immediates?
    * i.e. is the URL in wit/components an opaque reference to a package or a package version?
* [Robin] - Are component and module type packages still both separate and supported?
    * i.e. even
    * Peter: If the virtual filesystem is the place where the standard libraries/source for a runtime lives then perhaps their implementations would themselves be components rather than modules.
    * Peter: However, there are likely use cases for using modules that aren't expecting to use a vfs to store data and core module packages would be desired.
