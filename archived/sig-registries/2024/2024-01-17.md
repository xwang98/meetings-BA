Agenda:



Minutes:
- [cd joining late]
- [calvin]: cargo-component is refactored to use wac?
- [brian]: it might share code for interacting with registries
    - not going to be rebased onto wac too extensively, probably going to use warg-loader
    - [lann]: the conclusion i remember leaving off last week; was robin suggesting adding warg protocol support to warg-loader, but i haven't done any more work on it
    - the advantage of wac being the next integration point would be a way to introduce people to it in an already-new thing
        - wouldn't require changing workflows
        - what's that looking for you, brian?
        - for wac to be used by bytecode alliance that aren't peter, that is
    - [brian]
        - after the plumbers meetup, depending on the cycle with wasmtime
        - [lann] does wac have deps outside of the wac file
        - [brian] no, it parses from the file, looking for deps on the filesystem, then resolving from the registry
        - [lann] the conf file hasn't had many eyes on it other than my own, that's the part i feel less confident about
        - [brian] what are the contents of the conf file?
        - [lann] default registry: domain name, optional, probably want to default to bytecodealliance.org in WAC
        - namespace registry: maps namespaces to registries
        - configure individual registries with OCI auth
        - a few more things will be necessary: TLS settings
            - https://github.com/lann/warg-loader/blob/main/src/config/toml.rs
        - [brian] would rather have a config file than a thousand cli params
        - [lann] question is whether to separate warg from wac conf files
            - [brian]: could see the union of the wac options and the warg conf
            - [lann]: maybe a thing to change – might allow mutation of conf file after load, it might make sense to allow that
                - no, you can load and mutate it
                - wac could load the default file path and then override using its own conf file, that'd be fine
                - it might make sense for cargo-component to do the same thing – you might want a different default registry for
                  a particular project
                - [brian] would this be specified in the cargo toml for cargo-component?
                - [lann] it might sense to do both – to layer the configs – you can set default registry in cargo.toml, outside of the
                  cargo.toml in cargo config at any level, etc
                - you can override the namespace for a particular dependency as well
                - (this might not be easy to do with the current client interface, so that might be another thing to do)
                - [brian] I can create an issue in wac to use warg-loader, just to track it
- [lann] there was a meeting with the CNCF working group subgroup for artifacts – we should dump the notes from that into here
    - note link above
- relatively confident that warg can use part of that standard 
    - not sure what to do in the interim – didn't seem like a fast-moving process to me
    - once conservative approach would be to make the validation of warg-loader – the v0 manifest format – extremely leniant –
      "you just have to have a single layer with the string wasm somewhere in it" would be okay
    - or "application/wasm" content-type – though there seems to be some confusion about what a layer media type is
