Minutes:

- [lann]: warg-loader
    - recap for folks
        - we're doing something that has gone by multiple names – we'll call it "warg-lite" for now
        - get something that delivers a small subset of the features+semantics of warg using existing
          infra
            - ship with minimal operational burden
        - put up a proposal in github 1 week ago
            - broad agreement on phase 1, but disagreement on everything after
            - was looking for phase 1 agreement
            - everything else was context for where we could go after
            - in the context of phase 1: built an alpha quality [cli + warg-loader](https://github.com/lann/warg-loader)
                - this uses the OCI distribution spec as the (almost-)sole piece of infrastructure
                - I say "almost" becase I have added a feature, this `.well-known` [path](https://bytecodealliance.org/.well-known/warg/registry.json)
                - warg packages: namespace name + version
                - oci has the registry name baked in, however; works poorly when referring to a graph of things
                - the point of this file is to decouple the registry name from the package reference, basically
                    - added ociNamespacePrefix because a lot of oci registries don't let you choose
                    - demo is in zulip
                    - ```
                      $ warg-loader bytecodealliance.org test:pkg
                        Package: test:pkg
                        Versions:
                          1.0.0
                      ```
                    - basic-feature-wise, this is sufficient for getting people to start using warg for distributing
                      preview2 artifacts; this is my goal for this phase of work
                    - little more work involved in nailing down media types; this is also happening in the CNCF WG
                    - (I don't have a lot of opinions about media types; will follow what they recommend)
                    - looking for signoff
                        - [robin]: one comment
                        - whether or not to call this "warg" is the largest remaining question
                        - everyone agrees this needs to exist
                        - is warg OCI, or is warg a thing that can act OCI-like
                            - any reason not to support other kinds of hosts via warg-loader
                        - what do we call it, and are you open to extending this?
                            - wasi p2 wants two worlds to let people know that neither world is "all of" wasi p2
                            - don't want to call it warg unless there are two ways to reach content
                        - [lann] I thought about this – warg-loader is to avoid "warg-cli" as a name
                            - this is all to signal that this is just the oci version of this
                            - designed with that in mind
                            - this is the direction this is going
                            - [robin]: would like to make 2 backends a release requirement – even if the 2nd backend is
                              the simplest possible other openapi
                                - "warg over pastebin" as a joke
                                - maybe github releases?
                                - are we targeting the summit for this?
                                - [lann]: I haven't thought that far ahead; I just want people to stop copying WIT files
                                - [robin]: the other "api" could just be the warg protocol
                                - we just want to avoid warg == oci – that could be dangerous
                                - I'll look for another backend to add
                                - [calvin]: just to be clear about the warg protocol support, it's just pull, not push
                                - [lann]: yeah, just read-only
                                - [robin]: some tools will need the ability to push; cargo-component does pull and push
                                    - pull is the main idea, though
                                    - push gets tricky with multiple backends (discussion of what this means for a git repo)
                                - [calvin]: no authentication?
                                - [lann]: I just added support for docker auth; if you have docker logged in to an OCI service, warg-loader is automatically logged in
                                - via file in your home directory
                                - [calvin]: each package is one artifact layer?
                                - [lann]: an oci namespace (everything except the tag)
                                - [calvin]: meant in the manifest – only publishing one component object entirely
                                - [lann]: the code currently validates that only a single layer is of a given media type, that's the one it'll fetch if you ask it to fetch
                                    - [robin]: you could have other layers of other types, but not multiple layers of wasm
                                - [calvin]: should we be putting the oci manifest or the binary in the warg digest?
                                - [robin]: don't want to pull the oci manifest into warg
                                    - [lann]: only caveat would be the split component format, but agreed
                                - [robin]: wasm-split has been an area of discussion
                                - [CD NOTE]: we're out of space on this hackpad
