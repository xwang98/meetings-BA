* [Luke] naming/namespacing (continuing from last week)
  * Previous discussion reference: https://hackmd.io/@lann/B1M7L1epj
  * Many repositories. Each picks a "root namespace"; WASI would have a repository w/ root namespace "wasi:".
  * BCA picks its own namespace, e.g. "ba:". Can refer to the "wasi" registry by explicitly importing it. A Fastly registry would have namespace "fastly:" and import "wasi:" and "ba:".
* [Lann] wasm split draft: https://hackmd.io/@lann/HJ_f7geai
