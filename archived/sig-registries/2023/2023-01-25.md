* Component-model sync
    * bytecode alliance registry instance
    * game plan for JS is to follow in cargo-component foot steps
    * What is the budget for this and who hosts?
    * Content store can be external to the server registry
    * Publish as a github artifact and the registry can be configured to point to that.
* wasm-tools
    * Was a simple component
    * Now that we have resolver
    * Before it was something very simple that didn't pull in the full wasi ecosystem.
* Canonical splitting - in theory should be done straightforward
    * Registry prototype can use a simple non-splitting digest
* [Peter] cargo-component
    * sync with Guy
    * local filesystem registries with local files using warg protocol
    * This is useful for local vendoring
    * Now at the point that tooling understands and talking to the registries...
        * Now ingesting wit pieces, parser and bindgen
        * Goal soon: might not talk to all of the registries but has the underpinnings
            * to reference external packages
            * today cargo-component is all local
            * soon: I want to use this world with this package
    * cargo-component should be able to build stuff with remote dev
    * [Robin] let's share via a crate lib for the formats
* [Guy] updating js-component tools to work with the latest stuf
