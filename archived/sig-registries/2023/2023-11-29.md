Minutes:

- [Peter] WAC integration with the registry;
    - Give a presentation around registry integration with wac - downloading components and linking them together
    - effectively, this demo is a recreation of kyle's "tower of languages" during wasmcon
    - rather than using the gui to link components, we're going to use wac to do that
    - showcase that we can reference components by package id and the  tool will automatically download and link them in
    - proxy world w/greet fn
    - greeter world has a next function to create linked list of components; exports a greet function that the next will call
    - terminal only exports greet which will return empty string to indicate
    - (there are no optional components)
    - rust, golang, c, golang, js
    - showcase that we can use WAC to compose
    - all components published to registry
    - WAC is a superset of WIT, you can define interfaces and worlds; except it is a top-down procedural evaluation of the file; wac is sequential, cannot be spread across multiple files (currently)
        - has a package decl
        - instantiate pkg decl
            - triple dot syntax means "implicitly import outputs"
            - e.g., pull in all wasi interfaces
    - developed in a personal repo; once it gets mature enough -- integrate it into `wasm-tools compose`; will keep yaml & graph initially, but eventually steer towards WAC tooling
    - `wasm-tools compose` should be registry-aware
        - over the next month or two – should be in `wasm-tools compose` natively (jan, maybe?)

- [Danny] Dep solve
    - joel recently made it so wasm-compose was able to work on components that have resources
    - all of the stuff that we did back at wasmcon should be able to work now
    - when i did that i encountered an issue where wasm-compose was kebab casing package names
    - opened a pr into wasm-tools
        - fixes that issue
        - not super complicated PR
    - in anticipation of that, I refactored the depsolve PR
        - we should be able to use wasm-tools in that PR
        - have not gotten to integration tests yet; spin up a local server, publish packages to it, then confirm that a locked and bundled component generated from that matches expectations
    - call for reviews
        - Peter volunteers to review today
    - adds 3 commands to the cli
        - `warg dependencies <component>` prints tree
        - `warg lock` produces a locked component
        - `warg bundle` produces a bundled component
    - [kyle] can do a best-effort review, if we get things wrong we can go back and fix them
        - [danny] however thoroughly people want to check it out, that's fine!
        - [calvin] because it's not a protocol change we can issue patch releases
- [calvin] danny – the wasmtime issue
- [danny] I've done most of this dev with jco, so I stopped and used wasmtime for the first time
    - I was not getting proper wasi error types from wasi:io
    - might be mistake on my part?
    - [peter] might be a mismatch between the components-js/wasmtime versions (I ran into similar issues for my wac demo)
    - [lann]: have you considered adapting modules in wac?
        - it could pull the correct adapter from a registry, which is something that is painful for everyone right now
        - [kyle] so you could pull in a preview1 and say "adapt this for me" without having to have done that previously
        - [lann]: significant feature creep, though
        - [luke]: does align with virtualization though. just like with wasi-virt, i'm going to say how to wrap it up
        - [lann]: would that be a good place to do it? (not "will you do it immediately")
        - [peter]: do you anticipate referencing a module by id
        - I could see some value there
        - [luke]: alternatively, for the special case of "I have a core module, please componentize it for me", I though wit-component would do this
        - [peter]: cargo-component is registry-aware; ...
        - [luke]: hopefully the preview1-to-preview2 adapter is a finite wart
    - [danny] as the bundle/locking stuff gets merged; peter do you have any more thoughts about the prioritization of imports in cargo component will be?
        - [peter] i'm going to hopefully get to that this week
        - shouldn't be that big of a change
        - only on component dependencies right now, fairly straightforward
        - we have an issue in the componentmodel spec; i don't know if there's an easy way to say "there's an interface but it's also satisfied by this instance import"
        - [luke] the package name, you could say "/foo" which refers to an export [tktk cd didn't get all this]
        - [peter] no way to say "satisfy this import with this export of this package"
        - spec allows for projections in there
        - [luke]: may need to add square brackets "foo:bar/[foo:baz]" 

- [lann]: hyperium
    - quick show and tell
    - got adaptation code working between preview2 wasi:http and hyperium
        - we don't want hyperium's impl, just its types
        - example of axum running using wasi-hyperium: https://github.com/lann/wasi-hyperium/blob/main/examples/axum-server/src/lib.rs
            - (the registry is written on top of axum)
            - this is the first step to running the registry on top of wasmtime
    - [calvin]: what do you think we need to do for postgres?
    - [lann]: define a WIT interface for the storage layer and hide the postgres impl behind that on the host
        - until the socket story gets better
    - [calvin]: I started on componentizing different pieces of the registry and i'd love to help push that forward
        - it might needs some refactoring, I did it pre-resources
        - you'd probably do things a bit differently now
        - started down that path; don't know how we want to prioritize that work as a group effort
        - my head's still in getting the client/server-side compat; think we should cut a release after that
        - this stuff needs to get used
        - don't know how we should prioritize a refactor of the server
        - [lann]: major design changes i'm interested in making are allowing for a plugin architecture, to enable some more interesting features that don't make sense for every instantiation
            - doesn't require the http server to be impl'd in wasm; but it's nice to have
            - [kyle] making the policy trait into a WIT
        - [calvin] would be interesting to get design goals for the next refactor, determine what we're trying to achieve
            - [lann]: one of the main use cases is yours, calvin; to reuse the trickier bits of the registry server in alternative impls
            - [calvin]: that's helpful
            - both the client and the server -- you're doing a lot of the same validation logic
            - [lann] unless we have a specific alternative client -- the web client maybe
            - [kyle] the guest lang tooling that's not rust may want a client
            - [lann] i don't think anyone's loudly asking for that yet
            - [calvin] we do have some current issues iwth the reference server not having all the properties we'd like for production use; maybe that should be in the priority list
            - [kyle]: some possibility to split things up using components for scalability
            - [lann]: the ref impl could have some direct imports that would be virtualized for a more distributed impl
            - [kyle]: if the publish flow handler and the proof generating stuff and the log and map checkpoint builders were separate components it'd be easier to scale them individually
            - [calvin]: the issues i'd love to solve with a refactor: it's important to have a ref impl that can be used in production. I don't feel confident saying that today. That could be solved in a lot of different ways.
            - love to have that be a priority; produce something that could be used in production.
            - the ref impl has a lot of advantages today, serves as a good spec and a good test run, but
                - for this protocol to succeed in a much broader way, it'd be good to have a server people could run
                - [kyle] implements the fullness of mirroring and federation, instead of the base protocol-level support
            - [calvin]: being able to mirror other registries would be a good goal
            - what happens if the ref impl falls over and you want to recover the data from the mirror? it'd be painful to do that today. it'd be nice to have the ability to recover data and load state.
            - [kyle] more lifecycle flows that would be nice – pausing, snapshoting, restoring
            - [lann] it would be helpful to write down these business requirements as individual issues in github
            - we have discussed bits and pieces of this and i've lost track of most of those ideas -- having those persisted
            - [kyle] start with a tracking issue maybe?
            - [calvin] yeah. I still see the biggest risk of this project that this doesn't get used. We need to get the dev exp in the right place, that's not only this project but all of the other tooling.
            - [lann] that's all of webassembly.
            - [calvin] I know we're core contributors and we find it painful to work in.
        - [chris]: is there a list of user stories we're tracking across these?
            - [lann]: the things we build in rust and js are the implicit set of features
            - [kyle]: it's an ambitious list!

- [kyle] CLAW - component language for wasm
    - https://github.com/esoterra/claw-lang
    - [calvin] what's your dev path?
    - [kyle] issues filed; targeting having enough to demo at wasm.io
