WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And record on cloud. Now they.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Great welcome. Okay, now we've got the first bit of teasing trouble out the way we can get on something a bit more.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Bit more fun. Okay. So first off, thank you again unless it's all cheating trouble, and getting that the sig up and running, and a lot of logistics.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But hopefully, we don't have to do this too often, and this will get us all set up for future success.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I know this is nineteenth Federal holiday in the Us. And some people have it off. I wish my employer observed it, but they so I'm here working, but it's also six.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Am here, and Chicago and four Am. In the pacific region of the Us. And about seven Am.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In the East coast. So it's not the best time for a lot of people, and I really appreciate everybody who can make it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The reason for having it at this crazy hour is that we can all at least try to get together.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
There's no time zone that fits everybody who wants to participate in the sick. There's always an awkward, awkward time, zone, no matter which slots you pick.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So so. This is the first awkward one, so that we can pick more comfortable time slots.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:27.000
For future meetings and the goal in our charter was to select a representative or co-chair.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Who can help run these meetings from each of the time zones where we would like to hold it so a Us.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.000
For person based in the Us. To hold the Us. Time zones. At least one person in Europe to hold the European time, zones, and at least one person in China.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Oh, Asia Pacific, to hold the Asia Pacific time, so.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That would be really really useful.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Without a person in the time zone to host it. It would be somewhat impossible to host, because we would need to to cope with that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So in terms of how the meetings would work based on the time zones that we have, and the analysis on comparisons.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'll show you. It looks kind of like this, so I'm making a suggestion here, and this is open to debate and not Lockdown.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So my suggestion is to meet every two weeks that we have a European and China time zone, which seems to overlap quite well.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We have a Chinese and Us. Time zone, which also works quite well, and we have a Usa.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Europe Times, which works quite well, and by doing it this way, we basically spinning around the globe in the same direction.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So you're open china first china in the Usa. And then Usa.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Europe. Of course there may be occasions where we all need to meet, and on those occasions somebody's going to have an awkward time joining one of these meetings, but based on talking not only to to folks at the white code alliance, but also speaking to Mike Smith who is on W.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Three c. Rep. For Webassembly, who has run meetings across multiple time zones. This was his recommendation too.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So this means three three coaches, and he did age of pacific Europe, and Usa.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I know when we were setting up the sig and creating its charter so I had a quite a few people, and I was very thankful for it reach out to offer the services.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:52.000
This co-chairs, but since we kicked off the sig for the with the updated Charter, I haven't gone back to double check.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So this really is an opportunity for folks to debate the meeting cadence. If there any questions around this sort of plan, and then to see if anybody would like to volunteer as a co-chair.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So first question any questions on the meeting cadence? Does this sort of schedule basically make sense?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So far.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:32.000
From my point of view, this makes sense. The one thing I am curious about is, how is the alignment between those meetings done?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I could imagine that some talks China and China, Usa is et cetera, have different topics, different issues, different topics, issues.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Ideas are discussed. So how to get those different things aligned.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Very good meeting notes, recording the calls, and those people who can't participate following up offline.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So I did talk to Mike Smith about it, and that was his recommendation, too. The other thing is to make a call in advance to say, Hey, I really need to talk to X, y. And Z.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And get alignment on this point. Please come to this meeting. So there's a little bit of extra work for the coaches and corralling that and advertising the calls and advertising who might be necessary to be on those calls especially if it's one that they don't normally join but talking to mike he said that's the way he's done it in the past and

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:55.000
it's worked. There's just no easy solution to it so, and I wanna at this point also, thank Baby cause we had a quiet in depth discussion about the challenges of multiple time zones and setting things up.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And she was very helpful, too.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And if we are only like three participants, there's always a continuation about the participants. So like there's not two meetings where nobody from the last meeting was in, so so topics can be carried on now.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Hmm.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
That's the I. Yeah, that's the idea. There's always somebody who is in the last two meetings, so, as you will see and I will show you later on.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:34.000
There is maps and cadence and actual meeting times and schedule double checks which will go through, but we'll cover that shortly.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.000
First question. I wanted to go through. Was this one nominations I can mention the names who volunteered to me, but but that would just be a little bit of cajoling.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Is there anybody like to volunteer to take? Take on one of the co-chair roles?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Yup, I would be happy.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I think me again, and it's even better out also rolled in the chat for Europe.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Great.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
好。

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Yeah, I can. I weren't here to be culture or.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Agent踪。

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Great, great, and.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So we have. I'll put you down for shorts, hands.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And I'm not worlded the role. But if there's no nobody else, you'd like to volunteer, I can certainly take it on for the Us. So anybody in the Us.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Would like to volunteer.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Yeah, it can happen as a Co-chair.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
It was Hello.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
This was Emily. Or yeah, I only have one screen. I was just writing it down. So yeah.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Thank you, Dominic, I appreciate it. Okay. So awesome. And I don't know.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I'm happy with having a few more people to help out. That we actually need, because it always covers for folks being out sick, and especially with the multiple time zones.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So, but I don't know on policy, and like what happens next is, I think, we rewrite down the list of coaches we would like, and then we send it to the technology, steering.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And they double check it and make sure that the they're good with it. That's the process.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
As far as I know, we're really lucky to have baby on the call. Who's on the Tsc.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So is that right, baby?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Yeah. Basically, I just need to know, so that I can give you all the account privileges to make sure you're able to run the zoom and all that kind of stuff.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Awesome, awesome. Okay. Great. So why don't we do this?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I'll do this to as well, so we've got two from the Us. And two from the you I've got a load of people who can help out, which is actually fantastic, and I really appreciate it.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:32.000
This is five there. If there's any objections that there's too many, I'm happy to drop out, but just to make sure we built embrace the first few meetings that works more great cool.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Are there any objections to the folks that have been who are volunteered? Anybody says, Oh, goodness, Grace, it's not Chris.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He's been helpful and setting it up, but he should take a step back and relax.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I'd be happy. I'd be happy with that. But or if there's any objects to anybody's volunteer time time to raise it.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Going once, going twice, good. If we had too many people, then I would call for a vote but I think this is okay.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000
If there's an issue with the Tsc. And they say, Hey, hang on for you know, account security reasons.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We only want three people, then we'll come back and reduce the number. But if this is okay, we can move on.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Fantastic good. Okay. That? Well, let's move on.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
We got the co-chair list frequency and time zone schedule.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:11:01.000
This is the fun bit that kept me up last night looking at at world clocks and other people's meetings, and when they occur, and what we can do about it, and the practicalities setting this up, so I think I propose meeting every two weeks since to make sense from my point of view we can meet more frequently if we need to I I do know that there are some six

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:12.000
that me every week, and I will show you them shortly. I think, rotating through the time suits, participants works well, and we have this sort of knowledge.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Transfer from Europe, China, China to the Us. And Us. Back to you're up at some point, so it works.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
The.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Next thing is avoiding which days a meeting crashes just the next bit. We've got to talk about selecting a day of the week.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:43.000
This. This is what I've worked out from going through the get repositories for the Sigs, and looking at the Cg.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Meetings, and the Wazi Sg meetings and plotting them so there is a mixture, and people have have times and dates.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Some people meet every week, as you can see, with Sig packaging, meeting every week. Other people most people tend to meet every other week.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And some folks, I think, sick communities on a meeting once a month. A lot of the folks that are meeting tend to cluster their meetings in and around the Cg.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And Sg. Meetings, so they so they have all the meet. All the Webassembly community meetings kind of together at the same time which I can see makes a bit of sense, but it, does leave a couple of big holes in here which give Us.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Some opportunities my personal take and is that Mondays and Fridays are awkward, because they always end up being a public holiday of some sort.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Somewhere in the world, or and therefore less likely to happen, and this probably explains where we see a cluster between Tuesday and Thursday for meetings, and what it looks like when you look at it is we end up with these two holes we're like cool.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Maybe I will be good idea. But this is not the two holes, so really quick suggestion for meeting Kadence Tuesdays every second Tuesday, and every third Thursday, of the month.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Does that make sense to you guys?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
If it's every two weeks, it's just every second Tuesday that is Tuesday.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We could do. Second Tuesday last Tuesday. Any votes, any anybody care to comment anything that makes sense from your point of view.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And just.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So this means this. It's not like like every two week, but it's more like one week, and then three weeks.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We could do this. This is the beauty.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Hey? You know. No, no, it's just a question for my understanding. I'm a little bit trying to understand this table.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Yeah, this. These are all the spaces.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So I would say, trying to keep it. The same day would be great.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:23.000
So maybe Tuesday, maybe a Thursday first Thursday, and Thursday, second Tuesday, and last Tuesday, the month.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.000
They might work better. The reason for putting all the other things on there. Of course, in the Cg.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Yeah.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And S. Just to make sure we don't clash. So if anybody's participating in multiple six, they get the opportunity to.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Chris. If I understand this correctly, you would basically meet twice two rows.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Sorry. Two weeks in sequence, because you have that overlap right? So China and your china.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Sorry. Asia and Europe, Asia and us, and so you would have a meeting for the or the if you're from Asia, you'd have those two meetings sort of back to back, and then you wouldn't have anything for I think three.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Weeks is. Is that correct?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I think what we do. This is this is one of the reason why multiple brains are better than one, and I appreciate him.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Is that basically kick it off? And we would do. Maybe it would work like this first meeting would be.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I think it's Europe, China, China, us Europe, China, China, us. And then what was the last one?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Is where I go, that Europe, China, China, us us Europe. Right? So it would be Europe, China, China, us Europe, china.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So yeah, there would be a skip unless you wanted to.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
To do it one every week, because we're rotating. Yeah, so you'd miss the third meeting.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Get up earlier late for the third meeting.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And yeah.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I, I just wonder do we really need kind of a three? Kinda was three.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Combinations, because actually two will be enough to cover all the regions.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I am glad you asked, and I'm happy to reduce the complexity here dramatically. So let me show you what I did last night, going to time, Zone combinations, and I'm trying to find times that work for everybody so I did these time zone Maps where I went okay, if we put us specific central and East here and then we have central European

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:53.000
time, and time in beijing in china, where does it make sense overlap? And where do we get too late in the evening for China, or to early in the morning?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
For everybody else, and vice versa, started to map out. Where does this make sense? And I did it with a Chinese focus.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:14.000
A European. If this is a European-focused one, so you can see midday kind of in the middle, and then with China midday in the middle, and then I did the Us.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000
We day in the middle, and then I did East Coast. This is where we are today. This is where it is, and midday in the middle.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:41.000
So there's a little bit of a compromise for everybody, but if we can get time zones, if somebody's happy to compromise in a particular time zone to have a later, meeting then we can totally reduce the complexity here and have just two time sams but this is part. Of the reasons.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Why?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I mean the option would be, but I would really I'm not like this option is that that one of the continents or time zones like progress a little bit, so it will be one meeting.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Let's say you, Ceo, and one another one us, Asia. I really don't like this, because then there's no exchange between the second and third time, Zone.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And and, like this might be some loss and translation between the time zone. So I would really like to keep this rotating things, and everyone involved.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. So every two times zones can have a direct communication, opportunity.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
It's not that the other time Zone can't come along. It's just you've got a late meeting or an early start.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:36.000
This is how it works out. So it's just an awkward time. So what divorce?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I like the three meeting slots. I I think that works pretty well, and that's just for the main thing. I'm sure.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:51.000
If we have any special topics, we could then schedule those separately right, but at least having those times for the groups to interact and have enough overlap.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:01.000
I think I think, works well, I think shorting it to two. You might create some polarization on that.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Okay?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Right. Exactly.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Yeah, each combination get us together all six weeks if I cut it right, and every time zone is kind of yeah shifting and wobbling a little bit. But I think that's that's the way to go.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Yeah. So.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
If you go back to the slides with with us lots.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
The day, the week slots.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Yeah.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
I mean we could.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:51.000
So thinking loud, if you would put in every does this work kind of sell the appropriate group with the combined time zones.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Maybe this would help.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Yeah, but I think the proposal from Chris was that the groups would change all the time.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Oh God.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:09.000
So let's say we take. We take to Tuesdays, and then it would be second Tuesday.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Yeah.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Eu us, and then fourth Tuesday, Eu Asia, and then wrapping around in the second Tuesday would be China Us.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Yeah.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
So basically it would, because it's six weeks. It would like move along the way. So you would always have like two consecutive meetings, and then you have a four week break in your time.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Yeah.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:40.000
So time. So so this is how I understood that it would like move through the of days which will be a challenge to set up a outlook series with like.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Yes, yeah, and yes, or we can reduce that that break by having weekly meetings.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:07.000
If that suits, so we can increase the frequency, and just be mindful what I have done on these chats is when we pick the time of day for a conversation, just be mindful that we don't overlap with the meetings that exist at the moment so I have done.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Let me pick times. It's just called out, you know. It's basically these three three hours in which most of the meetings are occurring.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Because they're all clustered around together, so we could decide to do something like this.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
If we wanted to to pick one in Tuesday. Every Tuesday we meet. Let me just pick a time slot.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:39.000
That doesn't overlap.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And to be to be honest, I think it's doable, but let's go with this right now.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Let's go with every other Tuesday.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And then I think this might be a suit and C problem. Let's just try and set it up.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:14.000
See how it runs, and review it, and six weeks, and if it's not working we can update the schedule and change things with the first sig to go through the process of trying to cover multiple times zone.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
So it's not an easy selection, but.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:26.000
You're proposing the Tuesdays on the Non-wazee Cg weeks.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Correct.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Okay?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:44.000
So let's do this, says to be, Hey, this one, let me do this.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Okay, so that's my proposal just to give it a try. Set it up. If it's not working.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000
If the calendar invites the two confusing, if it's if they're moving about and everybody's calendar too frequently, and we need something a bit more stable.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:14.000
We'll just stop and change it, but we can give it a go. It can only not work, and then we can only fix it.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:34.000
So? How does that sound?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Yes.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
I think that works, I think scheduling is on outlook, or Google is probably not all that difficult, because we're gonna have three sequences, and they're gonna be set to meet every six weeks and they'll be all set by two weeks and so that that should be simple.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.000
The only reason I say that is, if anybody's on outlook or office, three, sixty five, and anybody's on Google, which is, I think, what the group is.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Any sort of complicated recurring meetings get totally foibled between those two systems, even to the stay.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:58.000
It's strange. So when we schedule these we should make the series as simple as possible, otherwise you'll create a chaos and everybody's calendar.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000
So?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Three series six weeks recurring. Yeah.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Yeah, I'm with you, man, I'm thinking. Three, three series, six weeks. Yeah.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:23.000
It's just really I had. I. This is why I probably I probably call for help, like just the Google Calendar, google groups integration and trying to set it up.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Just the logistics of that, and everything should work, but then, always getting a a huge number of bounce backs of undelivered mail.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Yeah.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
When you try to send a Google invite to a Google group, I can send an email, but the invite just bounce back.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000
So, then it was. Create it in your personal account. Export the Ics file attached to an email and send that to the group.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000
There was just no easy way of doing it. It's really frustrating.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:11.000
But yeah, okay, okay. So this try this Tuesdays, every every other Tuesday we got a good idea, and how we can set up the outlook schedule or the Google Calendar schedule.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:27.000
And probably end up doing both, and try not to class with each other, or calling on somebody who has a lot more experience of this that I do which is my crutch in this meeting is going to baby for some advice, because I know she's done this before on the best way.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Of getting this all set up and running. I don't know if there's any tricks that this for Google Calendar and outlook I I can Ping.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000
I can ping the the folks at the byte code lines. They've been really supportive so far, right?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Let's move on. And now we've kind of picked a day of the week, and the frequency and the next part part three, selecting a time zone time, zone, slot, so this is what it looks like with a European focus calendar when we look at overlaps with china which is the first first call so at this point I can see a huge chunk of

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.000
time. It seems to overlap early in the morning for Europe, and it's mid afternoon to the evening for China.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Any calls from folks in Europe for a particular time. Slot on a Tuesday which would work well.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Or can I suggest one?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Yeah, so it would work for me very good. But I think a lot of people are not too keen.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Is already seed to start this early in the morning. So maybe it would be rather nine or ten, so as many people like eight in the morning, so there wouldn't be any clash with my let's say work schedule this early in the morning but it's it is too.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Early, too which I'm telling you us guys now where it's like seven in the morning, or something.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Yeah, so, but it seems to be looking at the chat. So there seem to be people going for.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Yeah.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Yeah, I think seven is definitely too early is doable. Nine, nine, or ten, or is, are more preferable for me.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Okay?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Time zone.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Yeah. So one hour ahead of the Uk.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Oh, that's true. So nine Am. Would be eight Am. Uk.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Right.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Yeah.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I think cet is the Uk. Time.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Mosquito should be Berlin. I don't know the city plus one now.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Yeah. Okay.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Yeah. So i just wanna agree on the time zone before we vote for an hour.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Right.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000
All right. So when I look this up this because because I talk to our colleagues in Germany, not this. This is Germany.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Okay?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Yeah.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Yeah germany, france, centrally, western europe, you know, except for Portugal and Uk.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Yes.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Yeah.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Okay. Yeah, it works best for me to be honest.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
This time zone.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Yeah.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Okay. It seemed to work for Dominic. It was a stretch for Stephen. Are you okay with it?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And I'm fine with that, I think, in the chat with it, Merlin said definitely.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Not before nine is his suggestion.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Sorry for that.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
The only concern I would have with eight is that seven, eight, seven am. In Uk. Do you have anybody from the Uk here?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Yeah.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
好。

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:12.000
That's gonna have a problem with that.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Yeah.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Oh, sorry, yeah. And then the moth wrong. I think ten works best for me. Not eight.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
It's getting worse.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Okay? Can.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
I mean I can be flexible, but if my preference is done.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I move for making sure everybody has caffeine. How does this work from the for?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000
A Chinese colleague. Four o'clock in the afternoon. Is that okay?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
That's a perfect for me.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Okay, so that's I'm ten Am. Any objections to ten Am.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Can we make it work?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
I'm okay, but then I am.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Perfect. So let's say ten Am. For the first meeting, and then next meeting. I've got the Chinese time zone, and this is where we need to create a China us overlap.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
So this is what it looks like. It's early in the morning or afternoon. There's no nice match this time round, so I'm this is me.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:42.000
This is Chris. Chris is happy. We're slightly later in the evening, but this is Emily, and baby would be here.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:57.000
I think your East Coast, I think, and China. So how early in the morning does it work for colleagues in China? What would be a good early time?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:11.000
For me. So actually I have been working on daily seven and a meeting for a few weeks already, but I just wonder where that will be?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
How longer that would be continuing?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Okay?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:27.000
So a seven Am. No problem for myself, but not sure for others.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:37.000
I hear you. What about our other Chinese colleagues? How early in the morning is too early.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:52.000
I think maybe maybe a little early for some time. Channel guys, eight o'clock may be okay.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Oh, works for me. So eight o'clock. I'm all right, it's only once every six weeks, which is the good side of the meeting.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Cadence is only once every six weeks. It's gonna be a slightly late meeting to catch our colleagues in China and for an early start, and these colleagues so eight am okay.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Is okay for me.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Cool. What about our us colleagues, it's an eight Pm. Meeting for folks in the East Coast, and a five Pm.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Meeting for the Pacific folks any.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Strong objections to it? Can we make it work?

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
I can make that work. I think it's worth it.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Okay. Okay. So going once, going twice.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Gone, we will.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
It may be worth pointing out that while these might be someone uncomfortable, it is once every six weeks, so we're not doing weekly at these times.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Yes, yeah, yeah, that's the good side of it. Right? So everybody was like, Wow, every six weeks.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
That doesn't seem very frequent. And now everybody's like, yeah, I don't have to get up very early.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Oh, stay, stay late. Okay. So then the next bit is to pick a time zone for us Europe overlap, and I just plotted the Pacific version I don't do it.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Yes, this is purple bits here, and if we look at the east coast opens up a little more, so.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000
This is us today. This is what we're up to, which is far too early for colleagues in the Pacific regions to participate on.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Really the that, and appreciate it's not very convenient at all, so that kind of leaves this overlap in the afternoon, which I know working with colleagues in internally in Germany, that this is a very busy period of time where I overlap with them very frequently I was gonna suggest probably ten am Us.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.000
East coast. Time be seven Am. For the Pacific colleagues doesn't clash with any meetings.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:59.000
We could move it to here because we're not. We're not overlapping, and our meeting selection, but it's it's a five Pm.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Meeting for our friends in Europe.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Once every six weeks. Could you do it? Five to six Pm. Meeting?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
For me in Europe, I think four, five, and six. They're all valid meeting spots. I have no issues with any of those.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
The European side. I don't know about everybody else.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:31.000
From my point of view, from my point of view, is four or five Pm. The reason is, if it's after six prime, as I'm yeah, asked to start at seven or eight Am.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:46.000
In the morning I will hit the I will get in conflict with the law. Basically, in Germany, because after ten hours you have to stop.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Not a bad law.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:56.000
That's just like this. So, starting at seven am. Yeah, what about law? You're in some aspects. You're right.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Yeah.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
But that's I have not to choose it. I have just to follow it. So just after six Pm.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Your time. Zone is quite hard, so I'm also struggling regularly with the Wassam and Wazi meetings that start at six Pm.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Europe's time, still, because I have to find us not where I have to do a break kind of by law, right in the middle of the day, not to hit the ten hour.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Limit. Yeah, that's like. It is just my two sense on it.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000
So five to six would work, but six is a little bit too late.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.000
So five, six is Atm. In the Pacific region. I think that's okay. That seems reasonable to me.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
But then it's a ten Am. Meeting for me so, but it does like a whole lot more.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000
AA whole lot more comfortable than the current meeting at four Am. So.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Any objections to picking five Pm. European time eleven Am. Us. East Coast.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:18.000
So work for you, Emily.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Sorry about that. Can you say that one more time?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:31.000
No problem. This is eleven Am. Work for you prefer once every six weeks.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Right.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Exactly yeah, of usually, because it's like that is a populated meeting like time range. But yeah, yeah, yeah, we can do that.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Okay, great. So looks like we've picked time. Zones are time slots for each of the three meeting series will need to create.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Okay. So it's not impossible for colleagues. So the thing is. These meetings are not closed to people from the other time zones.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:09.000
You're more than welcome to come just at a really inconvenient time where people are usually asleep or all right, hopefully doing other more interesting things.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:17.000
But we have the time. Zone is picked great. So this was the bulk of today's meeting.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
We've managed to go through and get nominees for coaches and thank you very much for everybody who volunteered.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:32.000
It is very much appreciated. We've gone through and picked a meeting schedule so we're gonna meet Tuesdays every other Tuesday.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:44.000
There will be a meeting, and we've worked out the time slots for these meetings, and the rotation for them so we've done quite a lot of just basic housekeeping which we needed to do.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
And this is all the information that we can then give back to the yeah and get the meeting scheduled.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Set up. I I get repository, reconfigured, and then get these meetings sent out, so we should probably aim to start.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:11.000
I would say in the next off off slot for Tuesdays, which would be by off Slot.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
I mean next Tuesday, in which there isn't a Wazi. So Wazm, meeting.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:32.000
So we had one. This Tuesday, so first meeting would be well. The first meeting of the series would be Tuesday, the twenty fifth of June, and it would be the.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Us sorry. Eu China meeting, so does that work to kick things off so that would be the first meeting would be.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Ten Am. Tuesday next week.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Led by Dominic and Steven, and Sin from China. Sound good.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Yeah.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
If that works.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
I got a thumbs up. Perfect. Okay. So now I have a whole bunch of housekeeping to translate meeting.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Those look at transcriptions if it worked, go to the logistics of transferring this all over, so we've covered everything I needed to cover the get us all, up and running.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:34.000
I think next question is, as always, is there any other business? Do we have anything else to talk about?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Chris, you said you wanted a repository. Are you looking for like a bikecle alliance?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Slash, sig and bedded. I ask cause it'll probably be me making it so.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Good point. Yes, I think there was a call to set up in the you know, Charter, there was a request for I get repository as well for examples, and.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Code samples and stuff. So yes, please.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Yeah. So we had one for Sig registry, which is now been rebooted as sick, packaging.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:31.000
They ended up, not using their repo. I'm not opposed, but we'd originally created that with, you know, capital for the name.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:41.000
I suggest that developers like not capitalizing things. And so maybe they're not even using that project, so you can name it.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Whatever you want or however you want. I dropped what I would name it in the chat, and.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Okay, great. I can. Let's look at the chat. Yeah, because it's all hidden when you're presenting.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Lowercase, sig, hyphen, embedded.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
That's perfect.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Okay?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
This absolutely perfect. Thank you very much, baby.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:14.000
For the action items. So the culture nominees need to be will be presented to Tsc.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Or who is?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Yeah, I'll drop an email to the Tse with the co-chat nominees on the list.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:33.000
And then there is. There's a whole bunch of like.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:45.000
One password settings and zoom access to host a meeting, some creating the meeting schedule in zoom and all the rest of that that has to happen.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:54.000
So there's a better homework there, and coordination with the Tsc. And the Byte code alliance to get to use their resources to host meetings.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Yeah. And.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000
So that's we will go through offline.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:13.000
And another thing, sorry for the action items. So I assume that in invites will be sent out for the meetings will the coaches do this?

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Will you do this? So? Who is? Who is inviting people?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
I'm really glad you volunteered to take meeting note stomach me. I will do it.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Okay?

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Since I've battled with it already, and you've seen me try and post meeting invites like five different places.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Yeah. It's all good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Zulip, google groups, Google, calendar, outlook, calendars, all the rest of it.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Okay, so that we get is that.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
I would just checking. You're the only Chris in this meeting, so I have all the action items for Chris.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Sorry, Chris. I have one thing.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
But if there's a second one.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Steven, I think I heard you.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Yes, one thing I would propose. There was a question about continuity between the regions on these.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.000
One simple thing that we can do, and I'm just proposing this to the chairs of each of the groups is obviously we'll be taking minutes, and each of those calls.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Maybe the first thing we do in the in any of those meetings is read out the notes from the previous one, and then use those as discussion points, so that'll just provide that sort.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Of level set. At the beginning of the meeting. Does any other questions at least half of the group will be from the other region.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:47.000
So they'll be able to have some discussions if there's questions, and then, obviously, if there's anything that's in conflict, or you know, needs the wider group we can use, you know we can set up, another meeting to go do that but at least we'll have that overlap and so we can read out the notes get any sort of questions and then that becomes sort

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
of follow-on for the next, as we hand that off to the next region.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Yeah, that's a perfect idea. And yeah, and it's funny. So I think I was doing that last night.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:14.000
It was a discussion on memory sharing between modules on get and a for and they look like a natural overlap in approach.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:40.000
With what Deep D was suggesting at the in-person meeting. So there's another example of me trying to remember what Deepd presented share the information with the colleagues looking at the wamer extensions. But yeah, if anything to say half of it is that hand, holding and information sharing which is really important great suggestion steven thank you.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Chris, as as the you know, the chair of this meeting, you will upload the video to Youtube, so you're able to log into the zoom account and then add it.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
David mentioned that I think you're on boarded for that.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
I think so. Thank you for.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
哈哈哈。

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
If you're if you're not okay, okay, yes, cause I was just thinking about.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:25.000
You know the case where we're not able to record in some of the standardization meetings, cause some folks object to being recorded.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Yeah.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:34.000
It is. I think it'll be a lot easier for this group with the recordings being up and making sure that you get the video up before people meet because transcripts can be a little lossy, especially the the back and forth, I think and deep deeds presentation was really interesting with Ben and I don't know how easy that would have been to understand through.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Meeting notes.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Yes, yeah, it's good cool so, and thank you for reminding me about the upload thing.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:54.000
I've not gone through it before. But yes, that is something we need to do. I saw the Youtube credentials in the one password Session.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:04.000
It's like, okay. How that works never done it. So why, I might be calling on your expertise in the not too distant future.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Happy to help.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Thank you, Bailey. Much appreciate. Thank you very much. Okay.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:20.000
So we've got some tips for holding the meetings. I've got a whole bunch of action items, says chair of this meeting to wrap it up and hand over to my coaches.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:29.000
So there's a little bit of work to do for that. But I think with that I think we've covered everything we needed to do for the first meeting.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000
So. Yes, success. Thank you very much. Everybody for taking the time out coming along.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:46.000
To this I really appreciate. It's super early in the morning for us colleagues, and later in the evening, for our colleagues in China so much appreciated.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Everybody have a fantastic day, great evening, great afternoon, and I will see you in the emails meeting notes, Youtube video uploads and in the future meeting schedules which will be sent out.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Thank you. Perth.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
So you're very welcome. I will.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Thanks a lot for taking care.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
