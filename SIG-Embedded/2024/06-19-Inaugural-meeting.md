1. **Inaugural Item 1 :** Call for nominations & votes for co-chairs
    The embedded SIG's charter calls for 3 co-chairs, one for each of the time zones in which we expect to hold meetings.
1. **Inaugural Item 2 :** Select meeting frequency and time zone schedule for future meetings.
    There are some restrictions on the times available as the meeting schedule should avoid clashing with the Core WebAssembly Working Group, and the WASI Sub Group.

During the call, and at the start of the recording, it was suggested that [the transcript](./06-19-Artifacts/GMT20240619-111057_Recording.cc.vtt) of the call could be used to generate a meeting summary or synopsis. It was agreed that for this first meeting both approaches would be taken and the results compared. To support this the following is a ChatGPT generated summary of the call based on the meeting transcript. Note that no conclusion was made as to the validity of the approach, only that it would be attempted and evaluated in the next meeting.
